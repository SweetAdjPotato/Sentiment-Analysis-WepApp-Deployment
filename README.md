# Sentiment Analysis Web App Deployment 

In this project, a simple web app is deployed using Amazon SageMaker and PyTorch using the [IBDM Dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). The web app interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In this project, I deployed a sentiment analysis Web App through Amazon SageMaker and Pytorch using the IMDB Dataset. I first trained the model using LSTM model with hidden dimension set to 200 and epochs 10. The I deployed the model using Pytorch, with four functions model_fn, input_fn, output_fn, and predict_fn.
To sensure the model working well, I tested the deployed model and the accuracy score is 0.87. After ensure the model is accurate, I then deployed the model to a web app following: (1) create IAM role for Lambda function; (2) create a Lambda function; (3) set up API Gateway using POST method. Finnaly, I tried out the Web App using random reviews from rotten tomato, and the Web App seems to work pretty well.
